  <!-- ✅ TERMS & CONDITIONS SECTION -->
  <main class="terms-container">
    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>Welcome to JobLane. By accessing our website, services, or registering as a freelancer or client, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by the following terms and conditions. These Terms apply to all users of our platform.</p>

    <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
    <p>JobLane is a freelance service platform that connects businesses and individuals (Clients) with skilled professionals (Freelancers) for project-based work. We act as an intermediary to ensure quality, timeliness, and financial transparency.</p>

    <h2>2. Project Submission & Timeliness</h2>
    <p>Freelancers must complete assigned projects by the mutually agreed deadline. Timely delivery is a cornerstone of the JobLane experience. If a delay is anticipated, the freelancer must notify both the client and JobLane support team at the earliest.</p>

    <p><strong>Failure to Deliver on Time:</strong> In the event a freelancer fails to deliver a project on time without valid justification or notice, JobLane reserves the right to impose a compensation penalty. This may include:
      <ul>
        <li>Deduction of a percentage from the project payment</li>
        <li>Reassignment of the project</li>
        <li>Temporary or permanent suspension from JobLane</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payment Protection Policy</h2>
    <p>JobLane guarantees payments for freelancers upon successful completion and approval of projects. Clients must deposit the agreed budget amount before the project begins. This ensures payment security and trust across both parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Clients may request a refund only in cases of non-delivery, substandard work (verified by JobLane QA team), or freelancer misconduct. Partial refunds may be processed in milestone-based projects.</p>

    <h2>5. Code of Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Respectful communication between clients and freelancers is mandatory.</li>
      <li>Use of abusive language, harassment, or dishonest behavior will result in account termination.</li>
      <li>JobLane reserves the right to mediate and make final decisions in disputes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Unless otherwise agreed upon, all intellectual property created by the freelancer as part of the project is transferred to the client upon full payment.</p>

    <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>All parties agree to maintain strict confidentiality of project materials, communication, and financial agreements unless required by law.</p>

    <h2>8. Modification of Terms</h2>
    <p>JobLane reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Updated Terms will be posted on the website with an effective date. Continued use of the platform indicates acceptance of any changes.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding these Terms & Conditions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:joblane64@gmail.com">joblane64@gmail.com</a>.</p>
